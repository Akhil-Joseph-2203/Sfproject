      <p>The L B S College of Engineering was started in the year 1993, under the auspices of L.B.S. Centre for Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, an autonomous body owned by the Government of Kerala. The college offered B. Tech programmes in 4 branches; ME, EEE, CSE and ECE, with 240 seats, in a temporary building in 1995. The current campus was constructed at 52 acres of land given by the plantation corporation Kerala at Povval. B Tech in Information Technology with intake 60 and MCA with intake of 35 were started in 2000. B Tech in Civil Engineering was added to the existing programme during 2008. As part of expansion, additional 60 seats were added for Mechanical, Computer Science and Electronics and Communication Engineering programmes. During 2013-15, four post graduate programmes were added and Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering was recognized as a research centre.

The college is located in Muliyar Panchayath of Kasaragod district, the northern most district of the state. The Campus spreads over an area of 52 acres and is 12 Kms away from Kasaragod town. The nearest airport is Mangaluru Airport and the nearest railway station is Kasaragod railway station. The Bekal Fort, Madhur temple and Ananthapuri temple are the prime tourist attractions of Kasaragod district.

As of now, the college offers UG programmes (B. Tech.) in six branches viz. ECE, CSE, ME, EEE, IT and CE and one PG program in CSE.  The annual intake for UG programme is 480 and for PG Programme is 18.  The college was under Calicut university initially and later in 1996 under Kannur university. From 2015, the college is affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University.

The Institution started its journey commencing with an infrastructural area of 20,000 square feet. Within a period of two and a half decades, the institution was expanded to 2.5 lakh square feet. All departments have separate buildings. Apart from this there are two academic blocks with 50 class rooms, seminar halls, staff rooms and laboratories. The college also has its own hostels, an administrative block, a college main stadium, multi-sports play space and an open-air auditorium.

<h2 className="animate-text">Significance of the Institution</h2>

<p>Being a Government of Kerala undertaking college with a consistent and relatively good academic and placement record, the college is one of the most sought-after colleges in the Malabar region. The institution is located in the remote district Kasaragod, of Kerala state and is the only Engineering college under government sector in this region. The institution has been enabling students from remote areas of the district to pursue UG and PG programs in engineering and technology.

The college has been acting as a placement hub, by pooling all the nearby engineering colleges and making available quality students for MNCâ€™s and industries under one roof, since 2012. More than fifty companies were incubated from our institution and are well established in different metros now. These companies are at par with companies established from other National level institutes.  A strong alumni base provides inspiration and support for budding engineers in their placements as well as to establish themselves as successful entrepreneurs. Considering the socio-economic backwardness of the communities in Kasaragod, it is very relevant to claim that hundreds of girl students from this area have completed their UG and PG programs only because of having such an institution with the support of the Govt., in Kasaragod. Now on the completion of 25 years of sustainable success the college is planning to provide technical solutions to the problems faced by farmers in the region.

The college also boasts of an NSS Unit, which has won many accolades at state level, for consistently undertaking many socially relevant activities.

The newly established Skill Development Platform for Kerala (SDPK), along with ASAP, has conducted many skill acquisition programmes, to cater to the needs of young job aspirants.</p>
